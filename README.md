# Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce

**Project Title:** 🛒 Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce

**Domain:** E-Commerce and Retail Analytics

**📌 Real-time Business Use Cases:**

● Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Campaigns

● Personalized Product Recommendations on E-Commerce Platforms

● Identifying At-Risk Customers for Retention Programs

● Dynamic Pricing Strategies Based on Purchase Behavior

● Inventory Management and Stock Optimization Based on Customer Demand Patterns

**🔧 Project Tasks:**

**Step 1:** 📌 Dataset Collection and understanding

**Step 2:** 📌 Data Preprocessing

**Step 3:** 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Step 4:** 📌 Clustering Methodology:

**1️Feature Engineering:**

● Calculate Recency = Latest purchase date in dataset − Customer’s last purchase date

● Calculate Frequency = Number of transactions per customer

● Calculate Monetary = Total amount spent by customer

**2️ Standardize/Normalize the RFM values**

**3️ Choose Clustering Algorithm (KMeans, DBScan, Hierarchial etc)**

**4️ Save the best performing model for streamlit usage**

**📌 Recommendation System Approach:**

● Use Item-based Collaborative Filtering

● Compute cosine similarity (or another similarity metric) between products based on purchase history (CustomerID–Description matrix)

● Return top 5 similar products to the entered product name

**📱 Streamlit App Features**

**🎯 1️ Product Recommendation Module**

● Display 5 recommended products as a styled list or card view

**🎯 2️ Customer Segmentation Module**

● Display: Cluster label (e.g., High-Value, Regular, Occasional, At-Risk)
